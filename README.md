# TranslationTesting
This repository was created for the purpose of testing translation workflows using xliff.

None of the files in this repository should be taken seriously either as code or as examples of translation.
There's no guarantee the xliff files are even valid according to the xliff 1.2 schema, let alone the translations they contain being accurate.
